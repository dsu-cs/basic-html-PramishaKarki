                <h2>HTML Elements</h2>
                <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. They are represented by tags, which label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page.</p>

                <h2>Attributes</h2>
                <p>Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are always included in the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs like name="value". For example, the href attribute in the anchor tag specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.</p>

                <h2>HTML Comments</h2>
                <p>Comments in HTML are not displayed in the browser. They are used to leave notes or explanations within the code for developers. Comments start with &lt;!-- and end with --&gt;.</p>

                <p>That is all to be said about HTML for now. Here's a picture of a cat!</p>
